The eligibility criteria are strict, ensuring that only suitable patients are included in the trial. Patients must be between 100 to 180 days post ASCT, have a performance status of >= 60%, and meet specific laboratory values such as total bilirubin, hepatic enzymes, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and absolute neutrophil counts. Exclusion criteria eliminate patients with disease progression pre-day 100 after ASCT, certain medical conditions, and prohibited treatments. The criteria also address reproductive status, previous toxicities to dasatinib, and potential drug interactions.\nThe trial targets a specific patient population post-ASCT where dasatinib may have the potential to modulate the immune response and improve outcomes. The eligibility criteria aim to ensure patient safety and minimize confounding factors that could affect the trial results. Given the focused approach, adherence to strict criteria, and promising potential of dasatinib in modulating the immune system, the trial outcome is likely to be successful.",
