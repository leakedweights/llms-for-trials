In spite of time-consuming processes and high costs, the overall success rate of clinical trials is only 7.9%, which is a high risk for biopharmaceutical companies.\nThe four most important success factors according to research are the following: quality of clinical trials, speed of clinical trials, relationship type, and communication.\nPatient registration is a key factor in determining the success of clinical trials, and an analysis of clinical trials showed that 19% of clinical trials were terminated due to insufficient numbers of participants. Among the clinical trials that were terminated, many cases were found that were terminated due to failure in patient registration.\nThe speed of clinical trials is important when companies select clinical trial partners for rapid clinical trial progress.\nIn addition, it has been found that rapid patient recruitment for clinical trials affects the speed of clinical trial completion.\nIn terms of communication, Getz discovered that research sites with sufficient infrastructure for clinical trials are 41% better than sites dedicated to clinical trials in terms of patient enrollment.\nThe quality of clinical trials is an important indicator for moving clinical trials to the next stage.\nRegarding the quality of clinical trials, it was found that the adequacy of clinical trial planning and operation was the main characteristic.\nQuality in clinical trials also means the quality of GCP compliance.\nThe duration of clinical trials is a key factor in determining the financial risks and rewards of drug development projects.\nThe duration of clinical trials is 2.7 years, 3.2 years, and 3.8 years, respectively, for Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials, and the success rate from clinical trial success to new drug approval is less than 7.9%.\nRegarding the type of relationship between the sponsor and the collaborator,the success rate of clinical trials with partnerships was high.\nThe success rate of a new drug development project based on the number of non-industrial partners, not the pharmaceutical industry, and confirmed that the success rate of clinical trials increased by 11.3 percentage points when non-industrial partners participated. In many existing studies related to communication, it was found that close communication between the sponsor and the collaborator affects the success of clinical trials."
